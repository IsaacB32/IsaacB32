## âœ¨ Aboute Me âœ¨
My name is Isaac Browen, I am currently finishing my computer science degree at Chapman University!
I have a passion for video game development with an emphasis in gameplay programming. I enjoy learning new things and experimenting with stuff I've never seen before. 

## ðŸ§  Skills ðŸ§  
I have experience in Unity and Godot and have made several projects with each. I know C#, Java, C++, Python and a little bit of everything else (HTML, CSS, C, Ruby, BASH, ...)
Recently I've been learning about the Dragon Ruby game engine, a fast minimal tool for making games in Ruby.

## ðŸŒ± Learning ðŸŒ± 
- How to better structure code for easier readability and expandability 
- IOS Swift development 
- Anything that I find interesting and worth my time (mostly programming languages, new coding technics, and fun facts about our world)
